# Rosenblatt's Perceptron for binary classification

This repository is for the educational purpose of implementeting Rosenblatt's Perceptron.

## Overview of Algorithm
Rosenblatt's Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm primarly used for binary, linearly separable classification.

Concepts to keep in mind:
- Decision Function
- Weights
- Bias
- Output Value
- Update Value
- Learning Rate
- True Class Label
- Predicted CLass Label 

During the training, the perceptron updates its decision function after each misclassified example. These updates continually adjust the decision boundary. In the graph below, the decision boundary is the line seperating the two colored regions.
